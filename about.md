**Thinking in Genomes** is a question-driven blog about genomics,
evolution, and metagenomics.

Each post starts with a biological question and works through:
- the biological reasoning
- the type of data needed
- the appropriate class of analysis
- how to interpret results responsibly

I’m a computational biologist with a background in microbiology,
working in genomics and evolutionary biology.
